# About this project
It is high time for an easy, well-maintained, constantly developed, and secure pentest reporting tool: SysReptor is here.  

We're glad you're here to contribute and to make pentest reporting even easier.  
Thank you for investing your time.

We thrive for openness and broad availability to pentesting companies. This is why this project is source-available (but not Open Source) and SysReptor Community is free to use for everyone.

# Contributions not allowed?
Maintaining such a project is time-consuming and expensive. This is why SysReptor is a commercial product, financed by our SysReptor Professional customers. Thank you for this ❤️

We also want to make sure that SysReptor Professional features are exclusively available to our Professional customers.  
This is why the license of SysReptor does not permit modifying the source code and bypassing license restrictions.  
However, you might have the legal right to modify parts of the source code (like under Fair Use).

This is the reason we accept pull requests, even though the license does not permit modifying the source code.
Due to the legal complexity, we cannot verify if every single change to the SysReptor source code was legally permitted or not.
Accepting pull requests does not mean we also verified or acknowledged the legal status of the modification.  

# Contributor Agreement  
To make sure, we can use your changes without restriction, we are asking all contributors to sign our Contributor Agreement.  
Contributor Agreements are generally common and accepted in many Open Source software projects.

We tried to make the process of signing as easy as possible.  
You can sign our Contributor Agreement at https://cla-assistant.io/Syslifters/sysreptor using your GitHub account. Use the account's email address for your commits to successfully pass all checks for our pull requests.
